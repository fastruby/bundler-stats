Bundler Stats
=============

You remember that time someone yanked their library and the entire Node
universe fell apart? Yeah, me too. And all the thinkpieces that came out just
aftward were right: you should be careful about what you include in your
project.

This project gives you some tools you can use with your existing Gemfile to
determine which gems are including long trees of data, and which you can
potentially remove.
